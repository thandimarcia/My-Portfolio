            <ul>
                <li>Project 1: Creating an e-commerce website that will create jobs for domestics workers and give them the freedom to pick where they want to work and when they want to work. This will be achieved by having the costumer request using my e-commerce website called Simaphi Domestics</li>
                <li>Project 2: Working closely with public ambulances to curb the late coming due to them being on high demand, a perfect merger with uber but calling it emergency where there will be paramedic rookies and a driver that can take the sick fast and easy to the hospital</li>
                <li>Project 3: In public schools most learners are not noticed due to overcrowded classes and most teachers in South Africa only cater to kids that do academically well, leaving the struggling learners feeling even more inadequate. This NGO is to empower the underdog by having them learn the basics of coding using programs like CodeJIKA to create what they actually envision themselve to be and we also get people who have greatly passed their matric to be volunteer tutors to these kids</li>
